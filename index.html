        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <pre>Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, Catalan, German, and English footballers led by Joan Gamper, 
the club has become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism, hence the motto "Més que un club"
("More than a club").Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters own and operate Barcelona. 
It is the third-most valuable football club in the world, worth $5.51 billion, and the world's fourth
richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of €800.1 million.The official Barcelona
anthem is the "Cant del Barça", written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espinàs.
Barcelona traditionally play in dark shades of blue and garnet stripes, hence nicknamed Blaugrana.</pre>

        <h2>club rivalaries</h2>
        <pre><b>El Clásico</b>
Players jostle in Barcelona's 2–6 win against Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in a 2009 El Clásico.
There is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the
case in La Liga, where the game between Barcelona and Real Madrid is known as "The Classic" (El Clásico). From the
start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Catalonia and Castile,
as well as of the two cities.</pre>
<pre><b>El derbi Barceloní</b>
Barcelona players parade La Liga trophy around Camp Nou in May 2006 after defeating Espanyol in their last home game of the
season.Barça's local rival has always been Espanyol. Blanc-i-blaus, being one of the clubs granted royal patronage, was founded
exclusively by Spanish football fans, unlike the multinational nature of Barça's primary board. The founding message of the club 
was clearly anti-Barcelona, and they disapprovingly saw FC Barcelona as a team of foreigners.[213] The rivalry was strengthened by
what Catalonians saw as a provocative representative of Madrid.
Their original ground was in the affluent district of Sarrià.</pre>
